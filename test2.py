# as this was just a simple script to demonstrate using operators with variables I could've used input to get the a and b variables then another input to get the operator, but instead I decided to apply k.i.s.s. because the purpose of this script is just to demonstrate using operators with variables
a=1
b=2
c=a+b
print(c)
